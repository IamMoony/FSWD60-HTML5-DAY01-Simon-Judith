	<h1>Moves like Jagger</h1>
	<h2>Maroon 5</h2>

	<p>Just shoot for the stars if it feels right <br>
	And aim for my heart if you feel like it <br>
	Take me away and make it okay<br>
	I swear I'll behave</p> 
	<br>
	<p>You wanted control so we waited<br>
	I put on a show now we're naked<br>
	You say I'm a kid my ego is big<br>
	I don't give a shit and it goes like this</p>
	<br>
	<p>Take me by the tongue and I'll know you<br>
	Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you all the<br>moves like Jagger<br></p>
	<span>I've got the moves like Jagger<br>
	I've got the moves like Jagger</span>
	<br>
	<p>I don't need to try to control you<br>
	Look into my eyes and I'll own you with them moves<br> like Jagger<br>
	I've got the moves like Jagger<br>
	I've got the moves like Jagger</p>
	<br>
	<p>Baby it's hard when you feel like<br>
	You're broken and scarred<br>
	Nothing feels right, but when you're with me<br>
	I make you believe that I've got the key<br>
	Oh, so…</p>
